        <h2>The Short Version</h2>
        <p>
            Careers in Quantum is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference at the discretion of the conference organisers.

        <h2>The Long Version</h2>
		<p>
			Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
            <br/>
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
            <br/>
            Sponsors and attending companies are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors and attending companies should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
            <br/>
            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.
            <br/>
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately. Event staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.
            <br/>
            Event staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
            <br/>
            We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
