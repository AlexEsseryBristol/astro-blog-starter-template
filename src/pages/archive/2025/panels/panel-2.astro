    name: "Carrie Weidner",
    company: "University of Bristol",
    role: "Senior Lecturer",
    bio: "Dr Carrie Weidner is a Senior Lecturer in Quantum Engineering Technologies at the University of Bristol. Weidner did her PhD in JILA at the University of Colorado Boulder on inertial sensors using atoms trapped in optical lattice potentials. Weidner then moved to Aarhus University, DK to work on quantum simulation using quantum gas microscopy. Since moving to Bristol in 2022, her work focuses on (mostly) experimental quantum sensing, simulation, and information with atoms in optical lattice potentials. Dr Weidner also works in robust quantum control, quantum physics education, and is increasingly interested in the interplay between atomic physics and integrated optics.",
