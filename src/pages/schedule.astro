This challenging feat is the result of decades of research in light-matter interaction and photonic engineering and is readily compatible with multiple applications within photonic quantum information processing. In this talk we will take a brief look at the field of photonic quantum technologies and how they can benefit from high quality single-photon sources.

Recent research indicates that the neurodivergent population is drawn to STEM fields, meaning that a larger proportion of the STEM workforce falls under this umbrella. Despite this, many neurodivergent individuals encounter challenges that cause them to leave academic and research roles despite their potential to greatly contribute to research and innovation. In this talk, you will learn about neurodiversity and the many ways that neurodivergent individuals demonstrate strengths and encounter challenges in the physics workplace. We will then explore ways in which we can break down barriers for neurodivergent people in physics, focusing on cultivating a culture of neuroinclusion in your own working practices and how you can encourage colleagues to follow your lead.",

            <p>
                The main exhibition will run throughout the day from 9:00 to 17:00 in the Wessex Suite.
                <br/>
                Meanwhile, the talks and panel discussions will take place in the Marlborough Suite.
                <br/>
                The Marlborough Suite has limited capacity, and the day has also been deliberately scheduled to be tight. It is not expected for attendees to sit through all talks. We strongly encourage attendees to attend some, and then use the remaining time to interact with the exhibitors while talks are running in parallel. 
                <br/>
                Each talk session will consist of 15 minutes of the talk and then 5 minute of one or two Q&A and change over.
